# FULTRACKER

A website that track accademic infomation for student at Fulbright University Vietnam.

### ⁉️Reasons

Admittedly, I have to give credit to my group from Orientation Week at school for this idea. Seeing that the idea was great but got shot down by the school, I decided to continue this project to this day. I am building the website not only for the students of the school, which is its original purpose, but also to prove to the school that it needs to change.
